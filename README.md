# booth-algorithm
this is a program in which you enter two numbers and it gives the entire table with most of the steps as is done by Booth algorithm

## Input Format
enter multiplicant first<br>
then enter multiplier

*the program will handle the rest*

## note for output
the output will give the binary as well as the decimal value, and if the answer is negative it will print a "negative of"<br>
and automatically convert it to a positive value

## Notations used
m - multiplicant in binary<br>
-m - negation of multiplicant<br>
n - no. of bits in the product<br>
q - multiplier in binary<br>
a- accumulator<br>
